Toben Studio Inc. (hereafter “Toben”) has created this guide to ensure that creators conduct themselves appropriately when creating and publishing Creator-Generated Content (hereafter “CGC”) utilizing generative AI on the MapleStory Worlds platform (hereafter “platform”). 
 

# Defining Generative AI 
Generative AI (Generative Artificial Intelligence) is an artificial intelligence technology that can generate new content based on previously trained content, such as text, images, and music. Generative AI can help you work more efficiently and generate more creative content. Toben supports the freedom of creators to be creative and allows creators to utilize generative AI to create and publish CGC on the platform, provided that they comply with the content of this guide. 

# Types of Generative AI 
In this guide, generative AI is categorized as pre-generated AI, which refers to the use of AI technology during the process of creating CGC, and real-time generative AI, which refers to the use of AI in the platform in real-time after creating and publishing CGC. The content of this guide applies to both pre-generated AI and real-time AI unless otherwise specified. 

# Compliance Requirements when Using Generative AI 
When a creator wishes to create and publish CGC on the platform utilizing generative AI, they must comply with the following. 

1. **Compliance with Platform Regulations.** When a creator creates and publishes CGC on the platform with the use of generative AI, they must comply with the Creator Terms and Conditions of Use and Operation Policy. Toben provides specific guidance on what constitutes prohibited conduct for CGC on the platform, which includes any content that is sexually explicit, obscene, cruel, hateful, violent, inflammatory, fraudulent, misleading, infringing on the rights of others, invasive of privacy, or anything otherwise socially unacceptable and unnatural. If any prohibited content is detected, Toben reserves the right to issue restrictions in compliance with the Creator Terms and Conditions of Use and Operation Policy.

2. **Liability Regarding Use of Generative AI.** Creators must do their due diligence to see if they have the right to create and publish CGC on the platform using certain generative AI, and they assume all liability for any violations. Creators are expected to read and comply with the terms of service and policies when using generative AI outside of the platform for the creation and publication of CGC. Specifically, each generative AI may have different disclaimers, attribution, and commercial availability of newly created content, so creators must carefully review all of the relevant information and determine for themselves if they can create and publish CGC on the platform. 
Additionally, when using real-time generative AI, creators must use the proper methods that are recognized by the platform (HttpService function etc), and creators must also ensure that no CGC violates the Creator Terms and Conditions of Use and Operation Policy or otherwise causes any technological issues. If they are found to be in violation, they may be restricted in compliance with the Creator Terms and Conditions of Use and Operation Policy.

3. **Transparency.** If a creator has utilized generative AI on the platform to create and publish CGC, that fact must be clearly indicated on the platform for easy identification by other members. Specifically, creators must add text in the detailed description of individual worlds and avatar items that generative AI was used in its creation and publication. (Please take note of the example text below.) The above text must be added, and the creator may additionally indicate the use of generative AI on the platform by adding elements such as watermarks to the thumbnails. 
    > **[Example Text]** 
    > ※ The above world (or avatar item) includes content that has been created using generative AI. 
    > You can see more details about the use of generative AI in the CGC Creation Guide Using Generative AI. 
   
4. **Reporting.** When CGC that utilized generative AI is found to be noncompliant with this guide, a report can be filed through the platform. If reported content is found to be in clear violation, it will be addressed in accordance with the rules and regulations. Please refer to the [MapleStory Worlds Support Page](https://maplestory-worlds.zendesk.com/hc/en-us{"target":"_blank"}) for information about how to report CGC created with generative AI that constitutes a copyright infringement, defamation, or likenesses. 

<br>
<br>We hope all of our creators comply with the guidelines to ensure a smoother and healthier CGC creative culture. Thank you.
