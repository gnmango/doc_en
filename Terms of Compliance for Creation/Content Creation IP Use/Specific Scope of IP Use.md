We will guide you on the specific scope of use for both the IP provided directly by Toben and any game IP that was separately approved for use. 
The IP provided directly and any game IP that was separately approved for use could change or be updated. Creators must comply with the latest version of the guide. 

1. **Where can I find out whether the asset I'm trying to use is outside the allowed scope?**
If you have questions regarding assets outside of the guide, please use the following to submit an inquiry with details.

2. **If there is no guide on the specific scope of use among the IP provided directly by Toben or any game IP that was separately approved for use, how can they be used?** 
Depending on the IP provided directly or the game IP that was separately approved for use, the scope of use and the guide criteria could be different. 
If there is no guide on the specific scope, then you should follow the basic rules of IP usage when you create content. The following behaviors are typically prohibited. 

    * The IP is being used or has been used through promotions/collaborations with third parties in the game as described in each section of Article 3 of the Content Creation IP Use Guide. 
    * The content is either identical to or sufficiently similar to a game published by Nexon Korea Corporation, such that it could be mistaken for official Nexon Korea Corporation content. 

# MapleStory 
Any 2D side-side-scrolling RPG content utilizing the MapleStory IP (including unique MapleStory content serviced overseas) will be considered in principle as either identical to or sufficiently similar to the MapleStory game published by Nexon Korea Corporation. 
However, even if it's the above 2D side-scrolling RPG content, CGC creation and posting will be allowed if you only use IP from before the 6/30/2016 V update, including the 5th Job Advancement content. (This date is based on Korea MapleStory and each update for overseas MapleStory will be different.) 
  <br>
1. **Am I allowed to use any assets after the 6/30/2016 V update that include MapleStory 5th Job Advancement content based on Korea?**
If you are creating or releasing RPG genre content, you can only create that content within the limited scope outlined in the guide. For all other genres, you can use assets regardless of the allowed use scope for new assets. 

    * **Example 1**: In a defense-genre world, you could use a 5th Job Advancement skill effect asset on a certain tower's attack. 
    * **Example 2**: In a social-genre world, you could use the background asset from a region released after the 5th Job Advancement update. 
    * **Example 3**: In a casual-genre world, you could use a boss asset released after the base time. 
    * **Example 4**: In a world that is not an MMORPG genre (roguelike, CRPG, action RPG, etc.) and that has a low chance of being mistaken as official MapleStory content, you could update a character for a job released after the 5th Job Advancement update. 
    * **Example 5**: In an MMORPG-genre world with that could be mistaken as official MapleStory content, you cannot implement a region released after the 5th Job Advancement update.

2. **I am already creating an RPG genre World in MapleStory Worlds using MapleStory IP, and I have already implemented or I am developing assets outside of the allowed scope within the world. What should I do?**
Regardless of when the world was first created, creators developing in MapleStory Worlds must comply with these guidelines. 
If you are creating an RPG-genre world in MapleStory Worlds, you must comply with these guidelines even if you already implemented assets outside of the allowed scope within the world or if you plan to add such content in a later update.
