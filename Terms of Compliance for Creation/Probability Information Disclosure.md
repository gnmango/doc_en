# What Is Probability Information Disclosure? 
All creators in MapleStory Worlds providing probabilistic items they have created are obligated to notify users before using the items according to the Probability Information Disclosure Guide. 
* The MapleStory Worlds Probability Information Disclosure Guide aligns with the 'Guidelines on the Disclosure of Probability Information for Probabilistic Items.' Failure to follow these guidelines may result in maximum world usage limits. 

# Probability Information Disclosure Target and Method 
If any of the following applies, it may be subject to disclosure of probabilistic item information. Please see the Guidelines on the Disclosure of Probability Information for Probabilistic Items for details on the target and method of probability information disclosure. 
[Guidelines on the Disclosure of Probability Information for Probabilistic Items](https://www.mcst.go.kr/kor/s_notice/notice/noticeView.jsp?pSeq=17856{"target":"_blank"})

* What is a probabilistic item? 
    * This includes items that players purchase, directly or indirectly, for real money, whose specific type, effects, and performance are determined by chance. 

* Types of Probabilistic Items
    1. Capsule-Type Probabilistic Item: This is a probabilistic item that provides another item when purchased or redeemed, and the type, grade or performance of the item provided is determined by chance. 
    2. Enhancement-Type Probabilistic Item: This is a probabilistic item that can change the type (grade) performance of another item when purchased or redeemed, and the result of the change is determined by chance. 
    3. Combination-Type Probabilistic Item: This is a probabilistic item obtained by combining an item—purchased directly or indirectly by a user at a cost—with another item, and the type (grade) performance of the probabilistic item they obtain is determined by chance. 
    4. Additional item types to check other that the 3 above. 
        * A. Check any probabilistic items with a limited total quantity or offer period. 
        * B. Check any probabilistic items with changing probability information. 
        * C. Check any probabilistic items with a "ceiling" system. 
        * D. Check any probabilistic items that can be purchased with currency obtained via World Coin. 

# Probabilistic Item Compliance 
All creators of MapleStory Worlds must ensure they are in compliance with everything below in providing probabilistic items within equipped items. If you violate this or other items in the guideline, it may result in maximum world usage limits.
