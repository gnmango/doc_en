# Course Introduction
Badges are achievements that users can earn by accomplishing certain missions set by the creator. Badges are used to show the user's achievement goals or to encourage users to collect items, helping them enjoy the world further.

# Badge Registration
There are two ways to register badges. One is to register it on the MapleStory Worlds [Official Website](https://maplestoryworlds.nexon.com/{"target":"_self"}). The other is to register it within the Maker. The registration screen and process are the same, so creators can register badges using their preferred method.
Entering the badge grade, acquisition period, and badge thumbnail is required when registering a badge, and you can add badge descriptions as needed.
