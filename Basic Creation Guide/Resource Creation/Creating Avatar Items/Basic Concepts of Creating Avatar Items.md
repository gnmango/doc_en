* Items are also created for the Head, Body, and Arms parts. Draw the item according to the layer, and draw only on one side of the layer, as layers are one-sided.<br>![05](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/1656562341085cff05d9389cc4c5c9ff1699c4e69eba0.gif "06")
# Avatar Costume
Suit costumes and basic costumes are all drawn in the sheet. Sheets are provided in psd files which have separate layers.<br>Please refer to these guides: [Creating Pants], [Creating Coats]<br>![06](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/16455992831750c17309e8c164dd582a5a3e7de378694.gif "06")
#### Production Sheet Guide
To create items, you'll need specially prepared files. Each file has different layers with distinct purposes.
The gray layer is for guide purposes. Creators will do the actual drawing on <span style="color: #dc9656">**the yellow layer**</span>.

Images that make up the avatar have multiple layers. Avatars consist of a head, body, and arms. There are more layers for arms depending on their position relative to the head. 
The images are separated as the body goes below the costume, the costume goes below the shield, and the shield goes below the weapon. The height of each separated sprite is organized in the zmap file. If you edit the name of this layer, you cannot craft items.
Each sheet has zmap information and has an internal rule that fixes the name, number, and location of layers. You cannot change the names of layers.

Sample sheet and layers are composed as follows.

* To make faces that match various skin tones, first, draw a line in black (or a dark color), and then erase the outer line, double eyelid line, and the whites of the eyes to differentiate the transparency.
