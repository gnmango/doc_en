# About Property Editor

The Properties panel is an editor to view and change the properties of entities and components in the model. Among the components provided by MSW, property with the HideFromInspector Attribute does not appear in the editor and is only accessible from the script. To hide properties generated by the creator from the editor, select the Hide option in the Attribute Settings.
 In the Property Editor window, you can add, delete, and disable components of models and entities.

#### Edit Button
When you are setting up a collision area, you can adjust the collision zone in the Scene by clicking the Edit button. Please refer to the [Entity Collision](docs/?postId=175{"target":"_self"}) guide.

#### Increase/Decrease Cursor
When changing a Vector, Number, or integer-type value, you can use the mouse to change the value.
When the cursor moves near the value, it changes to the ![cursor](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/storage/icons/Cursor/cursor_scale_02.png{"width":"16px"} "cursor") shape, so you can change the value.
![PlusMinus](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/16956247765542533d53ec25841009cb68f6d39ab1b8f.gif{"width":"350px"} "PlusMinus")
#### Entering a Formula
In the Property Editor, items with a value of Vector, number type can use formulas.

* `+`,`-`,`/`,`*` operations are available.
* If the operation fails, the old value will be applied.
* For types that only support integers, the decimal point in the result will be discarded.

#### Selecting Multiple Entities
When multiple entities are selected at the same time, only the properties of the component in common are displayed.
When you change a specific value, the value is applied to all selected entities. If the selected entities have the same number of lists, they can be edited together. For example, you can change values from a list type such as edgeLists for CustomFootholdComponent to the same value if the Size number is the same.
