# Course Introduction
Using the coproduction feature, you can produce Worlds simultaneously with the team members you like. If you cooperate with your team members, you can concentrate on what you are good at, and you may come across new inspiration coincidentally. Let's find someone we can **make a beautiful and interesting World with**, and invite them to the group.

# Group Management Introduction
You can create groups and manage members from the MapleStory Worlds official client and [official website] (https://maplestoryworlds.nexon.com/{"target":"_self"}).

# See the Editing Situation
You can see the work situation with the icon created from the right side of the entry from **Workspace** and **Hierarchy**.
You can see the working members if you put the mouse cursor on the icon. The icon will be shown as below depending on you and other members.
#### Editing Status Icon
* ![my](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/storage/icons/Cooperation/icon_checkout_my.png): This is shown in the entry you're working on. Other members can access the entry when you **Check-In** after finishing the work.
    
    ![MyCheckIn](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/165951264937121b4736a686643cdb826e73f0ee16ad7.png "MyCheckIn")

* ![others](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/storage/icons/Cooperation/icon_checkout_others.png): This refers to the status wherein other members are progressing the work influencing the entry, and it's not applied to you. You cannot access it until the **working members Check-In**.
    ![OthersCheckOut](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/16595126827450aa46fce85ec4a80a07b1c04ae7471d3.png "OthersCheckOut")

#### Set Up the Right to Edit
In case you select an object of the scene or select it to edit the script, it will automatically **Check Out**.
However, the worker must manually **Check In** after all the edits are done.

1.  Select the entity's entry from **Workspace** and **Hierarchy**. 
2. Open Context Menu and press **Check Out** or **Check In**.
 
| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Check Out | Once you select an entity and start the work, others cannot access it. It shares the working status with others with <span style="color: #dc9656">**Locked by username**</span>. |
| Check In | When you complete the work, it shares the working status and allows other members access. |
| Bulk Check Out | The work can be started by selecting several or all entries from the high entry to the low entry. Once you start the work, others cannot access it. It shares the working status with others with <span style="color: #dc9656">**Locked by username**</span>. |
| Bulk Check In | Simultaneously share work details with all members at once that the work is done or the high entry is done by selecting several entities. It allows other members access. |

#### Precautions
1. If more than two members press the same entity simultaneously, only one can access it. The members who couldn't access it will see the failure window.<br>
![FailureMessage](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/172913165188960af9f9550d64232bd99feec9de6632e.png "FailureMessage")
2. If you change the name of one entity or the function name, all the entities that will be affected will automatically **Check Out**, and other members cannot modify it.

> <span style="color: #7cafc2">**Tip**
> If you don't check in the entity you're modifying and leave the World, the modifications won't be applied to all members.
> We recommend making it a habit to **Check In** whenever you finish your work. </span>

# Local Changes
In this window, you can see all items checked out by the worker in the group World. You can check what you've changed in Hierarchy, Workspace, and can **Check In** all items at once.
1. Click **Panels - Cooperation - Local Changes** to open the window.
![localChanges](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/170590776515736a73b5b5bad493086a242f33a677bb5.png "localChanges")
2. When the worker goes to **Check Out**, the entries, components, etc. that the worker worked on will be reflected in the window.
3. Select the entries you want to reflect the changed state, and then select **Check In** to reflect the changes in the coproduction World.

# Recovery Mode
Reverting the revision of a group World or using the **Import from File** feature will have a significant impact on the entire World. It's safer to do this task while all other members have closed the Maker. This means that you can revert a revision or import a mod file only after turning on recovery mode.

#### Turn on Recovery Mode
Recovery mode can only be turned on by the group leader or manager.
There are two ways to turn on recovery mode.

| Turn on Recovery Mode in the WORLD MENU Window | Turn on Recovery Mode in the Cooperation Window |
| --- | --- |
| Lobby - Create - Click [⋯] button - WORLD MENU - Turn on recovery mode<br>![[object Object]](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/1727178369778127c20cb26c74be89225d49e37ce4922.png{"width":"640px"} "1") | Maker - Panels - Cooperation - Turn on recovery mode<br>![2](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/bbs/16891480873844fa6bec1cabb4523886225fe0ad53f7e.png) |

If you turn on recovery mode, any work not checked in will be discarded, and you will not be able to edit the group World until recovery mode is turned off. If you turn on recovery mode while any member is still connected to the Maker, they'll have to leave the lobby, abandoning any changes they didn't Check In yet. So it's best to make sure that no members are connected to the Maker before turning on recovery mode.
