# Group Members Grade
The grades of group members are divided as follows.

| Grade | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Group Leader | <ul> <li>Grade given to the member who created the group.</li> <li>Only one member in the group can have this grade.</li> <li>Has full permissions to manage the group. However, the group leader can't leave the group.</li> <li>Group leaders can transfer their rank to another member, and when the other member becomes a group leader, the existing group leader automatically becomes a manager.</ul> |
| Manager | <ul> <li>Sub-admin of the group.</li> <li>Can use general permissions other than the exclusive permissions of the group leader.</li></ul> |
| Creator | <ul> <li>You can use most of the Maker features related to world production in the group.</li></ul> |
| Admin | <ul> <li>View inquiries from users of the world and respond to them. </li></ul> |
| General Member | <ul> <li>This grade is granted when a member first joins the group.</li> <li>Can play private worlds the group is creating. Can act as a closed beta tester.</li></ul> |
