# Course Introduction
You can use whatever resources you need from the extensive pool provided by MapleStory Worlds. 
You can also add your own resources and use them during creation.

# Finding Resources by Map Theme
MapleStory Worlds provides a **Preset List** to help creators easily create worlds. You can find resources by scrolling down the **Preset List** or entering a search term, but it might be difficult to find one in particular because there are many **Preset** resources provided.
<br>
Let's use the map filter function to select only the resources of a specific region theme in MapleStory. By pressing the **[Filter]** button next to the **Preset List** search bar, you can select only the map theme you want.
For instance, if you select only the **Henesys** checkbox, you can select only the resources used in MapleStory's Henesys map.

<br>
You can find the map you want faster by searching by map name in the **[Filter]** search bar.

You can find not only objects, but also other resources such as monsters, NPCs, tiles, and music in the same way. Use this feature when decorating a map with a specific regional theme.

# Introducing Resource Storage
MapleStory Worlds provides many resources in the **Preset List**, but not all resources are in the **Preset List**. You can take advantage of **Resource Storage** to find the resources you want from larger amounts of data.
The default location of **Resource Storage** is next to the **Scene** tab.

When the window is closed, you can open it by clicking on **Panels - Resource Storage** in the top navigation menu.

# Managing Resource Version
Creators can add resources directly to **Resource Storage** or the **Workspace - MyDesk** folder. If you're going to allow the remaking of your world upon release, you should consider where your resource should be added. The location of the resources determines the extent of resource updates and remakes.

If you add your resource to **Workspace - MyDesk**, you can modify the resource after release without affecting remade worlds. However, if you modify your resource from Resource Storage, it will affect all remade worlds.
It won't matter if you're not planning to modify your resource, but if you are planning a modification, you are recommended to add your resource to Workspace only.
