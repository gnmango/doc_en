# Course Introduction
Testing is essential to reliably updating the content of an already-released world. In order to detect and fix unexpected bugs in advance, creators can test various situations by opening a test server and distributing server keys to a limited number of people. 
Today, we will look at how to create, connect to, and close a test server.

# Creating a Test Server
Go to the detailed information page of a World released by creators. Press the [â‹¯] button to open the context menu and click the **[Open Test Server]** menu.

You can enter the test server or copy the server key in the pop-up window that opens afterward.

# Connecting to a Test Server
Click **Join Test Server** to connect to the test server.

Only those who have entered the server key in the Join Server window can connect to the test server.

# Closing a Test Server
After the test is over, creators can close the test server.
There are two ways to close the test server.
* From the context menu on the World Details page
* From directly inside the test server

| World Details Page | Test server |

When the test server is closed, the server key is also destroyed.
