# Course Introduction
In this course, we'll learn about items and passes, products that can be sold in the World. Let's learn about the products and register products you'd like to create.
Products can be purchased with World coins that users own. In return for purchasing products, creators should provide users with various services, such as passes. Creators can later settle up the World coins paid by the users.

# Registering Products
There are two ways to register a product: either register it in the MapleStory Worlds [Official Website](https://maplestoryworlds.nexon.com/{"target":"_self"}) or within the Maker. The registration screen and process are the same, so creators can register products from their preferred location.
Products are categorized into two types: Items and Passes. Creators are required to select and register one that matches the type of product to sell. 
When registering a product, you must input its type, name, price, sale period, release state, and product thumbnail, and you may add a product description if needed.

Products are classified according to product characteristics as follows. <ul><li><span style="color: #dc9656">**Item**</span>: It is a product available for repurchase.

For instance, it is used for creating a product that provides an additional benefit when a reward is given in the World.</li></ul> |

# Product State
There are five product states in all. When you test a product in the Maker, you can purchase it regardless of its state. If the product is to be actually purchasable in the World, its state has to be <span style="color: #dc9656">**On Sale**</span>. 

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Unreleased | The release state has been set to Unreleased. Even if the product reaches its sale period, it will be invisible and unavailable for sale in the web and World shops and the Client. Neither will it be shown in the product lists of players who own it. |
| Waiting for Sale | The product hasn't reached its sales period yet, and it is waiting to be sold. It will be automatically switched to **On Sale** at the start of the sale period if you set the period with the released state. |
| On Sale | The product is purchasable. If you've set a sale period, it can only be sold during the period.|
| Sale Ended | The sale period has expired, and the product cannot be sold in shops. |
| Restricted | The product is under restriction. Sale of the product is not allowed regardless of its release state or sale period. Creators can modify restricted products, but inquiries regarding their restricted state should be made to the Customer Center. |

# Registering Products in the Group World
