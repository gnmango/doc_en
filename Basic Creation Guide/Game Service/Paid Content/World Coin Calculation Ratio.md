# Course Introduction
In this course, we'll take a look at how world items and avatar items (meaning "creator-generated content", herein "CGC items") sold by a creator are converted into revenue. Upon selling CGC items in MapleStory Worlds, a certain amount will be paid out as the creator's revenue in accordance with a set calculation ratio. Please refer to the following for details about the calculation ratio.

# World Coin Calculation Ratio
MapleStory Worlds deducts 65% of CGC item sales and gives the remaining 35% to the creators in USD.  
Please refer to the graph below for details on the calculation ratio.

**Sales Charge (30%)**
When selling CGC items, a sales charge of 30% is automatically deducted. 
The sales charge includes the transaction fees from each store such as Google or Apple, PG fees, and others.
MapleStory Worlds does not charge any fees other than the sales fees deducted from product sales.

**Toben (35%)**
When selling CGC items, 50% of the revenue from the sales fees deducted (70%) is paid to Toben Studio Inc. 
The fees are used for the server, DB, and solution maintenance as well as development to provide a better platform, R&D, marketing, or other such administrative and maintenance costs.

**Creators (35%)**
When selling CGC items, 50% of the revenue from the sales fees deducted (70%) is paid to the creator.
