# Avatar Product Sale State
The sale state of an avatar product changes depending on the release state, payment for the registration fee, sale period, restriction, and so on. Sale states are categorized as follows.

| Sale Status | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| Unreleased | You've set the release state as 'Unreleased', and even if the product reaches its sale period, it will be invisible and unavailable for sale in the shop. <br>Products which players already own will not be visible. |
| Waiting for Payment | It is a step in which you need to pay for the registration fee to complete the product registration. |
| Waiting for Sale | The product's sale period has not begun. Once the sale period begins, the product will switch to On Sale. |
| On Sale | The product is purchasable and will remain so until the end of the sale period, if one has been set.  |
| Sale Ended | The sale period has ended and the product is no longer purchasable in shops. |
| Restricted | The product is under restriction. <br>It is invisible in shops and cannot be sold to users. |

Even if sale of the product ends, players who have already purchased it can continue to own it.
