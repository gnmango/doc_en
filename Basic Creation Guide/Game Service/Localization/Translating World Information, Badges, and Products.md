# Course Introduction
If the creator provides translations for the created world's information, items, badges, and avatar item information, users from other regions will be able to better enjoy the world. The [Official Website](https://maplestoryworlds.nexon.com/{"target":"_self"})'s translation management menu can be used to directly input English and Korean translations.
This guide will teach you how to apply translations to world information, products, badges, and avatar products.
