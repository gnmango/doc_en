This is the last step in creating a world where monsters are killed by long-range projectiles. Let's have the character attack a monster with a projectile.

# Press the attack key to fire projectiles.
1. Open the **PlayerAttack** script and add the property as follows.
    ```lua
    Property:
    [Sync]
    Vector3 ProjectileOffset = Vector3(0, 0, 0)
    [None]
    string ProjectileModel = ""
    [Sync]
    number Damage = 10
    ```

2. In the Property Editor of **Workspace - DefaultPlayer**, modify the properties of the **PlayerAttack** component as follows.
    * **ProjectileOffset : X = <span style="color: #dc9656">0.4</span>, Y = <span style="color: #dc9656">0.4</span>**
    * **ProjectileModel: In the context menu of Model_Projectile_Arrow**, select **Copy Entry ID** to paste the copied value.
    <br>
    **Offset** value can be adjusted appropriately according to the sprite used in **Model_Projectile_Arrow**.
    <br>
3. Open the **PlayerAttack** script again and modify the content of the `AttackNormal()` function. Set the execution space to **Server Only**.
    ```lua
    [server only]
    void AttackNormal()
    {
        local playerController = self.Entity.PlayerControllerComponent
        local transform = self.Entity.TransformComponent
        if playerController and transform then
        	-- Modify to fire projectiles when the character presses the attack key.
        	local lookLeft = playerController.LookDirectionX == -1
        	local projectileOffset = self.ProjectileOffset:Clone()
        	if lookLeft then
        		projectileOffset.x = -projectileOffset.x
        	end
        	local projectileEntity = _SpawnService:SpawnByModelId(self.ProjectileModel, "Projectile", 
        						   transform.Position + projectileOffset, self.Entity.Parent)
        	local projectile = projectileEntity.Projectile
        	projectile.ToLeft = lookLeft
        	projectile.Firer = self.Entity
        	projectile:Fire()
        end
    }
    ```
    <br>
4. Modify the `CalcDamage()` function as follows.
    ```lua
    override int CalcDamage(Entity attacker, Entity defender, string attackInfo)
    {
        return self.Damage
    }
    ```

# Set Up Monster Collision Group
Set up a collision group to check collisions between projectiles and monsters.
1. In **Workspace - BaseEnvironment - NativeModel**, add each **TriggerComponent** to <span style="color: #dc9656">**StaticMonster, MoveMonster, ChaseMonster**</span> and set **CollisionGroup** to **Monster**.

    <br>
2. Place the desired monsters on the map appropriately.

# Test
Let's press the **[Play]** ![play](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/storage/icons/tool/icon_play.png "play") ![start](https://mod-file.dn.nexoncdn.co.kr/storage/icons/tool/icon_play.png "start") button and run a test.
When you press the attack key, the projectile flies and explodes when it hits a monster or after a certain amount of time.

# Application
By changing the **SpriteRUID** of the projectiles and effects used, or by changing various properties such as damage and speed, the creator can implement the desired ranged attack.

Refer to this guide any time to you need to create a ranged attack for your creations.
